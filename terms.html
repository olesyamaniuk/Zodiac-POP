          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            These terms and conditions apply to the Zodiac POP! Bubble Shooter
            app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that
            was created by (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free
            service.
          </p>

          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically
            agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you
            thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the
            Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application,
            any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly
            prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the
            Application, translate the Application into other languages, or
            create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks,
            copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
            related to the Application remain the property of the Service
            Provider.
          </p>

          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application
            is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve
            the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at
            any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that
            any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly
            communicated to you.
          </p>
          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            The Application stores and processes personal data that you have
            provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It
            is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
            access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise
            against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing
            software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
            operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your
            phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your
            phone's security features, and may result in the Application not
            functioning correctly or at all.
          </p>
          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that
            have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the
            Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by
            the Application:

            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume
            responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the
            Application require an active internet connection, which can be
            Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service
            Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not
            function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you
            have exhausted your data allowance.
          </p>

          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be
            aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still
            apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider
            for data usage during the connection to the application, or other
            third-party charges. By using the application, you accept
            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges
            if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e.,
            region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not
            the bill payer for the device on which you are using the
            application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the
            bill payer.
          </p>

          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility
            for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your
            responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your
            device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service,
            the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.
          </p>

          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of
            the application, it is important to note that while they strive to
            ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on
            third parties to provide information to them so that they can make
            it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for
            any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of
            relying entirely on this functionality of the application.
          </p>

          <p class="q-f-policy-terms-text-one">
            The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some
            point. The application is currently available as per the
            requirements for the operating system (and for any additional
            systems they decide to extend the availability of the application
            to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you
            want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does
            not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it
            is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating
            system version installed on your device. However, you agree to
            always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The
            Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application
            and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination
            notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any
            termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
            terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if
            necessary) delete it from your device.
